Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder-acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Srila Prabhupada single-handedly spread Vaisnava/Hindu dharma all over the world, establishing 108 temples and several schools in India and throughout the West.\nSrila Prabhupada, a highly educated leader, exemplifies the kind of education that BGIS offers and the kind of graduate that BGIS hopes to produce. He was kind, bold, influential, humble, humourous, gentle, balanced, hard-working, respectful, highly spiritual, determined and an excellent communicator - both as a speaker and as a writer.\nHe felt equally at home in an Indian village and in a busy Western metropolis. He could converse meaningfully with a simple worker and a head of state. Business, math, the gentle art of persuasion, philosophy and four languages - he was proficient in it all. He cared deeply for people and touched the hearts of all he met.\nWe at BGIS are awed by his abilities and character, and we hope that this, his school, continues to represent his qualities and pass them on. Which is what we strive towards through our teachers and students.\n\nKnow more about Srila Prabhupada</p>\n          <h2>Mission Statement :</h2>\n          <p>â€œTo prepare fine citizens of the world, men of character and competence, who can lead and inspire others.â€</p>\n          <!--h2>Goals :</h2>\n          <p>To train and educate for personal success in the following:<br />\n â€¢               the art and science of loving and serving Krishna (Bhakti Yoga)<br />\nâ€¢               academic and co-curricular requirements for future study and work character development and life skills</p-->\n        </div>\n<div class=\"down\">&nbsp;</div>\n<h2 style=\"position: relative;font-size: 15px;color: #a0030b;margin: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;margin-left: 10px;\">Donate For Complete Education</h2>\n<div class=\"down\">&nbsp;</div>\n  <div class=\"donate_main_links\">\n  <div class=\"donate_in\">\n   <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"/contributes/online-payment\"><img src=\"../img/campus.png\" class=\"masterTooltip\" title=\"New BGIS  Development\" /></a> </li>\n      <li><a href=\"/onlinepayments/c92b26f68689c7af56b0b08721897732\"><img src=\"../img/cow.png\" class=\"masterTooltip\" title=\"Cow Care : Help us maintain the cows for a year.\" /></a> </li>\n      <li><a href=\"/onlinepayments/2cad8fa47bbef282badbb8de5374b894\"><img src=\"../img/invest.png\" class=\"masterTooltip\" title=\"Invest for your future\" /></a> </li>\n      <li><a href=\"/onlinepayments/b7a782741f667201b54880c925faec4b\"><img src=\"../img/nature.png\" class=\"masterTooltip\" title=\"Nature Care  : Support 15 trees for life.\" /></a> </li>\n      <li><a href=\"/onlinepayments/14ee22eaba297944c96afdbe5b16c65b\"><img src=\"../img/sponser.png\" class=\"masterTooltip\" title=\"Child Education, Sponsor the Education of One Child for a year  including residential charges .\" /></a> </li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</div>', '2014-03-13', 1),

Our emphasis is on creating character in each child who joins us.  The character will be formed if given proper training from the very child hood.  However whenever a child joins BGIS at any age, we inculcate in the child the fundamental spiritual, moral & social values which can mould a child to become children with perfect character & competence who can lead and inspire others.<br />\n    <br/>\n   The candidate has to appear for an admission test which will determine the child\'s aptitude in English, Mathematics and Science. This will be followed by an interview with both the child and  the parents.</p>\n  <br/>\n<h2 style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Please call Admission Office to fix your Admission Date.</h2>\n        <h3 style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Admissions open for classes 2-9 only</h3>\n        <h3 style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Next Admission Dates Will Update Soon</h3> \n  <br/>\n  <img src=\"../img/iconvenue.png\" / style=\"  position: absolute;margin-left: -3px;\">\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px !important;\n  font-family: calibri;\n  color: #000; margin-left: 42px;\">Venue</h2>\n  <p style=\"\n  margin-left: 42px;\n  font-size: 17px !important;\n  font-family: calibri;\n  color: #7e7e7e;\n  line-height: 142%;\">Bhaktivedanta Gurukula and International School<br />\n    Bhaktivedanta Swami Marg,<br />\n    Raman Reti, Vrindavan, Mathura<br />\n    Uttar Pradesh, 281121</p>\n    \n  <img src=\"../img/iocntime.png\" / style=\"  position: absolute;margin-left: -3px;\">\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px !important;\n  font-family: calibri;\n  color: #000; margin-left: 42px;\">Timing</h2>\n  <p style=\"\n  margin-left: 42px;\n  font-size: 17px !important;\n  font-family: calibri;\n  color: #7e7e7e;\n  line-height: 142%;\">Timing: 10.00 AM Sharp<br />\n    Registration fee: 1000/- Rupees</p>\n    \n    <img src=\"../img/iconhowtopay.png\" / style=\"  position: absolute;margin-left: -3px;\">\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px !important;\n  font-family: calibri;\n  color: #000; margin-left: 42px;\">How to Pay:</h2>\n  <p style=\"\n  margin-left: 42px;\n  font-size: 17px !important;\n  font-family: calibri;\n  color: #7e7e7e;\n  line-height: 142%;\">You can enrol for admission test directly at school reception office.

Especially in village areas, people are not well aware of family planning measures due to which the control on population becomes weak. And this in turn pushes these people more below the poverty line. With lack of money and more mouths to eat; the common solution for them becomes not sending their children to school. One reason being lack of money for education and second reason being the thinking that these children are better of earning than learning.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n	This is one of the major factors why children are not getting educated and strong steps need to be taken to help educate such underprivileged children. And one of these steps is charity. Yes! Helping a needy child with education will not only bring prosperity to his/her future but also happiness to the society and priceless blessings for you. There are many ways in which such charity can be done like:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally helping children to study by teaching them for free</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributing small amounts of donation to NGOs helping educate children</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donating good amount of money directly to children&rsquo;s parents</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sponsoring a child via a medium of donating fees for that child&rsquo;s education to the school in which he studies</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n	ISKCON, is one of the famous global organizations that supports the importance of education.

Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the conservation of energy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental laws appeared to be quite independent of each other. By means of the theory of relativity they have been united into one law.

Itâ€™s this new thing called a â€œvideo testimonial.â€ In plain English, itâ€™s basically a mini commercial for your biz, but you can write your own script, choose your own actor, and itâ€™s pretty darn cheap for what youâ€™re getting.  I tried it out for my own biz and it turned out great. Itâ€™s like a review for your business but it looks like an actual customer did it, blogging about your product because theyâ€™re so satisfied with it.
